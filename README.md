Project Overview
This project automates the process of extracting UI elements from websites, generating test cases, and creating Selenium test scripts. The workflow consists of three main tasks:

Web Scraping & UI Element Extraction
Test Case Generation using GenAI
Selenium Script Generation using GenAI

Task Descriptions
Task 1: Web Scraping & UI Element Extraction

Accepts a public website URL (e.g., https://demoblaze.com)
Uses Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup or Selenium to extract UI elements:

Buttons
Links
Input fields
Forms


Saves the extracted elements in a structured JSON file (elements.json)

Expected Deliverables:

Python script for web scraping
elements.json file containing extracted UI elements

Task 2: Test Case Generation using GenAI

Uses a GenAI model (GPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.) to analyze elements.json
Generates 3 to 5 meaningful test cases based on the UI and functionality of the site
Exports the test cases into a structured .xlsx file

Expected Deliverables:

test_cases.xlsx containing test cases with fields such as:

Test Case ID
Test Scenario
Steps to Execute
Expected Result



Task 3: Selenium Script Generation using GenAI

Uses the test cases generated in Task 2
For each test case, automatically generates a corresponding Python Selenium script using AI prompts
Exports each generated script into an Excel (.xlsx) file

Expected Deliverables:

test_scripts.xlsx containing:

Test Case ID
Python Selenium Code (as a string)



Technologies Used

Python (Required)
GenAI Models (GPT, Claude, Perplexity, etc.)
BeautifulSoup/Scrapy (For web scraping)
Selenium for web automation
Pandas for Excel file operations

Implementation Details
Task 1 Implementation
The web scraping script uses selenium to parse the HTML of a given website and extract UI elements. It identifies buttons, links, input fields, and forms based on their HTML tags and attributes, then structures this information into a JSON file.
Task 2 Implementation
For test case generation, we use a GenAI model to analyze the extracted UI elements and generate meaningful test cases. These are then structured and saved to an Excel file.
Task 3 Implementation
Test scripts are generated by prompting a GenAI model with the test cases from Task 2, requesting Selenium code that implements each test case. The resulting scripts are saved to an Excel file.
How to Run

Clone this repository
Install required dependencies:
pip install requests  selenium pandas openpyxl webdriver
now run the google colab file named untitled13.ipynb and download the test_cases.xlsx file
this is my gen ai conversatio link : https://chat.deepseek.com/a/chat/s/629f5e4c-c02d-4df3-9183-770e2e2888e5   for task 2 and task 3 
Challenges and Solutions
Web Scraping Challenges

Dynamic content loading: Some websites load content dynamically using JavaScript, making it difficult to scrape with BeautifulSoup alone

Solution: Use Selenium WebDriver to render JavaScript before scraping



GenAI Integration Challenges

Structured output: Ensuring the AI generates properly structured output for test cases and scripts

Solution: Use specific prompting techniques and parse responses carefully



Selenium Script Generation Challenges

Element identification: Generating robust selectors for UI elements

Solution: Use multiple identification strategies (ID, CSS, XPath) for resilience



Future Improvements : 
Support for authentication and handling of login-protected pages
Enhanced test case prioritization based on UI element importance
Integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous testing
